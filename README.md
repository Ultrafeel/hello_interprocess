# hello_interprocess
in the program there shall be three processes: A, B, C.
 Process of A is used for the continuous data entry from the user (number). Process of A shall transfer the number entered by the user to process of B using the PIPE mechanism. Process of B shall square the entered number and using the shared memory mechanism to transfer result of squaring to process of C. Process of C shall consist of two flows: the flow of C-1 and a flow of C-2, at the same time a flow of C1 shall accept B data from process using the Shared memory mechanism, the flow of C2 shall display once a second arbitrary message on the terminal (for example "I am alive\n"), but at the moment when the flow of C1 accepts B this from process - value = XXXX" where XXXX - the number transmitted via the shared memory mechanism from process of B (Result of exponentiation of the number entered in the course of A) shall display on the terminal the message ". If result of exponentiation = "100" (i.e. the user entered number 10), then the program shall send SIGUSR1 signal to process of B which in turn in case of receiving such signal shall finish correctly operation of all three processes (A, B, C).
